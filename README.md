# FSAE-MY24-Brake-Calcs

This matlab script calculates the optimal brake characteristics for the MIT FSAE MY24 car.
It uses parameters for the car generated during our design requirements design phase, so they may not exactly match the final product.
The tiremax file contains mapping data to map tire characteristics, taking an input normal force on the tire and giving an associated longitudinal force the tire can produce.
ImprovePlot.m is a script I found that makes the plot showing overlap between the two acceleration models more legible.
